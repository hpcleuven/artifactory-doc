This section contains examples on how to start using Artifactory for a few
package types. For an overview of all explicitly supported types, visit
[https://jfrog.com/integration/](https://jfrog.com/integration/).

The code samples are assuming a UNIX-like command-line interface
and make use of the following conventions:

* API-KEY: a valid API key (see the [Platform](../platform) page)
* USERNAME: your u-account (`u0xxxxxx`)
* NAMESPACE: namespaces are used in certain repositories to distinguish
  between different user groups. Valid NAMESPACEs then correspond to the
  name(s) of the Artifactory group(s) associated with your account.
* ARTIFACTORY-URL: the KU Leuven Artifactory main page (i.e.
  `rdmrepo.icts.kuleuven.be`)
* REPOSITORY-NAME: the name of an Artifactory repository (of the relevant
  type) to which you have access.
