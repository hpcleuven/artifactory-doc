It can be convenient to restrict the list to only include the repositories that
are associated with your research group. This can be done by adding these
repositories to your Favorites.

API keys are used for authentication when interacting with Artifactory from
the command line. You can generate such keys on your user profile page
("Welcome, u0xxxxxx" > "Edit profile").
